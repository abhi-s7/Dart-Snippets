BASICS

1. int
2. double
3. bool
4. String 'Abhishek' 'a'


1. int - Stands for integer

There is no smallint bigint in dart
Bit range - -2^Bit to 2^Bit - 1

If size of int is 1byte
then 1byte = 8 bits
Now 1 bit is reserved for +- 
And rest 7 bits are for range

Therefore   (-2^7 to 2^7 - 1) i.e. -128 to 127

int
1. smi - smallint
2. mint - mediumint
3. bigint

They have reserved 32 bits for 32 bit machine and 64bits for x64 bit machine
and bigint is based on RAM size

Therefore dart chooses the size of int according to availabilty of hardware and it is very flexible language
