DART

- Open Source 
- Developed by Google
- 2011
- General Purpose Language Dart + (Node.js, Flutter, Angular)
- Statically typed language

This means it's a Strict language. 
i.e. we cannot change the datatype of a variable once we have defined it
e.g. var name = 'Abhishek'
Now if I want to change name = 1000; // it is not possible 

while the above is possible in JS because JavaScript is Dynamically Typed language

 - var a = 100; //type inference

This means 'a' has become an integer behind the scene because the value feeded to it is a integer
It automatically detect the type based on the value.


- DART does not have Compilation Phase it only has Runtime Phase
- It's an Object Oriented Language
- Syntax inspired from c++, Java, JavaScript
- Everything in dart is an Object

- Clould as well on local environment
- Functional Programming
- Async Programming //server
- Multi paradigm - OOPS + Functional Programming + Async Programming
- It can mimic the dynamic type using a special keyword called 'dynamic'
