::Basic Level Dart

Dart Types(Basic and Acvance), Variable
1. final vs const
2. operators
    a. Null aware
    b. Null aware and assignment
    c. is
    d. is!
    e. in
    f. ~/
    g. Cascade Notation - ..
        Chain of methods
3. if-else, ternary operator, switch case, continue with label
    String in case
4. Loops, Labeled Loops
5. Loop vs Iterator (for in, forEach is a function, and it is wrapper on top of iterator)

Dart is OOP +  Functinal Programming + Async Programming

::Functinal Programming in Dart
1. Types
    a. Named Functions - As they have name thus they can be called N times
    Java Style (Statically Type)
    Javascript Style (Dynamically Type)

    b. Anonymous Functions - No name function

    Since they have no name therefore they cannot be called more than 1 time unless you declare it any Variable
    They are also nested function
    therfore useful in forEach

    c. Fat Arrow - Single Line code Func
                - It can also be assigned to a Variable

2. Parameters
    a. Optional Positional Parameters
    b. Optional Named Parameters
    c. Default Parameter - Either with optional positional or named positional

3. Main Args (N) -> command line arguments

Functinal Programming
a. Nested Functions - global functins and loval function, wrap function
b. CallBack - passing a logic as an argument (forEach, fileHandling)
c. Closure - A.K.A Lexical Closure
d. Lexical Scope - scope of variable in case of nested fn
